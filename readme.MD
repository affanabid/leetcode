# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, to improve my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

I am currently following the **LeetCode 75** study plan and solving **two problems daily** with a focus on consistent learning

## Current Focus
- LeetCode 75
- 2 problems everyday

## Problems Solved
- 1768 - Merge Strings Alternatively
- 151 - Reverse Words in a String
- 1071 - Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
- 1431 - Kids with greatest number of candies
- 238 - Product of Array except self
- 605 - Can Place Flowers
- 345 - Reverse Vowels of a String
- 443 - String Compression
- 283 - Move Zeroes
- 1679 - Max Number of K-Sum Pairs
- 334 - Increasing Triplet Subsequence
- 11 - Container With Most Water

## Language
- Python

## Repository Structure
- Each solution file is named using the corresponding **LeetCode problem number**  
  Example: `151.py`

## Goal
To build strong algorithmic thinking and prepare effectively for technical interviews through disciplined daily practice.
