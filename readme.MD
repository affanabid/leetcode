# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, aimed at strengthening my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

I am currently following the **LeetCode 75** study plan and solving **two problems daily** with a focus on clean, efficient, and readable solutions.

## Current Focus
- LeetCode 75
- 2 problems everyday

## Problems Solved
_Add solved problem numbers below as progress is made:_
- 1768 - Merge Strings Alternatively
- 151 - Reverse Words in a String

## Language
- Python

## Repository Structure
- Each solution file is named using the corresponding **LeetCode problem number**  
  Example: `151.py`

## Goal
To build strong algorithmic thinking and prepare effectively for technical interviews through disciplined daily practice.
